            <h3>Developing Myself</h3>
            <h3>Without Limit</h3>

            <p>
              Last year I was feeling kind of depression as my versity was off
              and also my laptop broke down during pandemic.So I had less
              options to learn but I didn't stoped myself.Learned some soft
              skills like communication spoken english etc.I hope all these will
              help me in near future.

              Keep every detail of a project centralized in real time so
              up-to-date info can flow freely across people, teams, and
              tools.Use new roadmaps to sketch out the big picture, communicate
              plans with stakeholders, and ensure your team stays on the same
              page.

              My dream car is tesla model S P100D.Tesla was founded in 2003 by a
              group of engineers who wanted to prove that people didn’t need to
              compromise to drive electric – that electric vehicles can be
              better, quicker and more fun to drive than gasoline cars. Today,
              Tesla builds not only all-electric vehicles but also infinitely
              scalable clean energy generation and storage products. Tesla
              believes the faster the world stops relying on fossil fuels and
              moves towards a zero-emission future, the better.
